# Analysis Scripts

The following scripts takes files generated by the main `MetaGPA` pipeline for further analysis.

---

## Phylogenetics

`phylogenetics.py` takes the following files from the main `MetaGPA` pipeline:

- `all_contigs_pfam_a.gtf`
- `modified_contigs_pfam_a.gtf`
- `unmodified_contigs_pfam_a.gtf`
- `modified_contigs.fa`
- `unmodified_contigs.fa`

### Requirements

- muscle
- RAxML

### Usage

```bash
python phylogenetics.py --pfam <pfam_name>
```

where the `pfam_name` can be any pfam name of interest

### Output Files

1. `<pfam_name>.faa` pfam fasta file
2. `<pfam_name>.index` index of contigs
3. `RAxML_*.<pfam_name>.tree` raxml output files

---

## Co-occurrence

`co_occurrence.py` takes the following files from the main `MetaGPA` pipeline:

- `modified_contigs_pfam_a.gtf`
- `pfam_a_statistics.csv`

3. package installed on R:
cooccur
   
### Usage

```bash
python co_occurrence.py --number 20
R < co_occurrence.R --no-save 
```

Other options:

```bash
--number  generate a matrix file for the top chosen number of enriched pfams as listed in the pfam_a_statistics.csv file, int, default 20
```

### Output Files
1. `enriched_pfam_a_matrix.csv` file to be used in co_occurrence.R 
2. `enriched_pfam_prob_table.csv` cooccur output file      
3. `significant_negative_correlation.csv` positive correlations with p < 0.05
4. `significant_positive_correlation.csv` negative correlations with p < 0.05

## Differential Conservation Score

`differential_conservation_score.py` takes a multiple-sequence-aligned fasta file (e.g. `muscle`)
and generates position-specific differential conservation scores.

### Input file

In the fasta file, protein sequences are separated into two groups base on the prefix of headers.
For example, the following fasta file has two groups: "CONTROL" and "CASE".

```
>CONTROL_001
MTA...
>CASE_001
MSG...
>CONTROL_002
MTA...
```

Differential conservation scores are calculated between the "CONTROL" and "CASE" groups.

### Requirements

Python 3 libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib

### Usage

```bash
python differential_conservation_score.py \
--aligned-faa ./test_data/aligned.faa \
--prefix-1 CONTROL \
--prefix-2 CASE
```

For more details, use help message:

```bash
python differential_conservation_score.py -h
```

### Output Files

1. `differential_conservation_score.csv` containing 3 fields:

```
1   position
2   fraction_present
3   differential_conservation_score
```

2. `differential_conservation_score.png` position-specific plot of scores
